        it doesn't have to be good, it doesn't have to make sense, it doesn't
        even have to be finished. it just has to exist. this site exists to celebrate daily rituals and art. it's a place to show up for yourself, and be part of a community doing the same.

      <p>
        your streak counts how many days in a row you've shown up. miss two and
        it resets. it's easy to continue your streak by changing the thing you make to something you can do every day, like doodling, or making a sandwich, or taking a photo. whatever you want to make.
        you can sync your streak across devices with your secret key, found on the leaderboard page.
