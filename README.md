https://makesweird.art

Is a minimal *single purpose* habit/ritual tracker for making weird art (or anything else) every day. No email, no password, just a single secret token used to sync your streak across different devices. Check in daily, build a streak, see what other are making on the leaderboard, and chat with the community, if you want.

Miss one day? Your streak is safe. Miss two in a row? It resets.

# Philosophy
1. **Minimal footprint:** The entire site is tiny (bandwidth) by design. There's less than 40 lines of css.
2. **Ephemeral:** The chat stores 100 messages at a time. 
3. **Privacy-first**: No email, no tracking, no analytics.

---

# Stack
1. pure vanilla html, css, js
2. chat uses [PartyKit](https://partykit.io) for websockets
3. Redis for db.
