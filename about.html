<p>this is a reminder to make <span id="thing">weird art</span>!</p>
<p>it doesn't have to be good. it doesn't have to make sense. it doesn't even have to be finished, it just has to exist.</p>
<p>your streak counts how many days in a row you've shown up. miss two and it resets.</p>
<p>one secret key. no email. no password. we store your streak, username, and nothing else.</p>
<p>this site is made by hand, and tries to stay under ~10kb.</p>
<p>it's also <a href="https://github.com/parka6060/makesweird.art">open source</a>.</p>
<p>now go make something.</p>
